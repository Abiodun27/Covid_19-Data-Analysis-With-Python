# Project Title
 Nigeria COVID-19 Data Analysis using Python
 
### Project Description, Introduction and Objective
In this project, data science & analytics skills were used to collect data, explore the data, perform analysis, create visualizations, and generate insights.
The data source used is divided into different parts, and the data used are combined to perform analysis and provide insights which can obtained from:
1. NCDC COVID-19 official website, data was obtain the by performing a web extraction or web scraping.
2. Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE), daily data on confirmed, death and recovered cases for Nigeria was obtain 
   from their repository and related insights derived.
3. The Nigeria Community Vulnerability Index data, which was also used with datasets related to the pandemic cases, such as deaths, lab confirmed etc to determine relationships 
   and correlations in your analysis.
4. The Real Domestic Gross Product Data, also used to determine the impact of COVID-19 on the economy.
5. The State Budget Data which was also included to determine the extent to which each states reduced their initial budget due to the impact of COVID-19 on the economy.
The following questions and hypothesis were explored using charts and plots, in order to derive more insight from the datasets and answer the questions.
Python visualization libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn were used to generate plots and charts.
    * Top 10 states in terms of Confirmed Covid cases by Laboratory test
    * Top 10 states in terms of Discharged Covid cases
    * Top 10 states in terms of Death cases
    * Total daily confirmed, recovered and death cases in Nigeria
    * Determine the daily infection rate
    * Calculate maximum infection rate for a day (Number of new cases) and the date
    * Determine the relationship between the external dataset(CCVI) and the NCDC COVID-19 dataset
    * Determine the relationship between the population density and the laboratory confirmed cases data.
    * Check the relationship between region and number of death cases
    * Check the distribution of Epidemiological from CCVI dataset
    * Check the relationship between Health System(CCVI data) and No of Death Cases
    * Check the effect of the Pandemic on the economy
    * Check states whose budget is affected most by the pandemic
